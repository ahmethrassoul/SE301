## SIMD experiments

### Stage 1 - The vector sum example like previously

In this third part we will evaluate the interest of SIMD computational units. This first example is intended to allow you to take a step back on the use and interest of the SIMD approach and the performances obtained according to the implementations.

This first pedagogical example that you know well by now (sum of two vectors of N elements) will allow you to observe an automatic and manual implementation of the INTEL and/or ARM instruction set and to evaluate the gains in terms of execution time. 

1 - Open the file containing the computational functions (src/vadd/???/???) and analyze it.

1 - Compile the program (simd_vec_add)

2 - Run the program from the terminal.

3 - Analyze the results obtained. Try to explain the results obtained. You can use :

Once this is done, go to the next part
