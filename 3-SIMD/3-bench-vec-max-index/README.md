## SIMD experiments

### Stage 3 - One more time

To push yourself a bit further, you will now have to write a function that allows you to calculate the position of the maximum value.

1 - Open the file that contains the calculation functions (src/vmax_index/???/????.cpp) and complete the function vec_max_index_???.

2 - Compile the program (simd_max_index)

3 - Run the program from the terminal to validate the behavior of your function.

4 - Analyze the results obtained.

If you have not become masters of SIMD programming, you have understood the basic concepts. You will not have experienced all the subtleties of the thousands of instructions available, nor tested entire data formats, but you should have enough knowledge to speed up our galaxy collision application.

However, before you tackle this application, there is one last step to take.
