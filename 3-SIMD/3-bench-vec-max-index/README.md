## SIMD experiments

### Stage 3 - One more time

To push yourself a bit further, you will now have to write a function that allows you to calculate the position of the maximum value.

1 - Open the file that contains the calculation functions (src/vmax_index/???/????.cpp) and complete the function vec_max_index_???.

2 - Compile the program (simd_max_index)

3 - Run the program from the terminal to validate the behavior of your function.

4 - Analyze the results obtained.

Let's process a final example before moving to CUDA implementation.
