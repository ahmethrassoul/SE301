## SIMD experiments

This directory contains a set of simple examples that use SIMD to parallelize compuations on recent CPU targets for simple algorithms.

The first directory contains a pedagogical example made for you by your teacher. You should run it and discuss the performance level obtained. The next two directories contain examples that you have to complete yourself !

Have fun...
