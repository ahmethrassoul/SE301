## CPU experiments

### Stage 3 - Evaluate memory access patterns on performances

The third experiment of this section aims at studying the impact of memory access patterns on performances. Indeed the memorization and access to information will be impacted by the number, size and hierarchy of the caches present in the system. 

In this example, we have voluntarily chosen to set the optimization flag to the value "O2" to simplify your analysis of the results. IYou don't have to write anything here, your work is limited to reading and understanding :

1 - the software code described in the function 

2 - the software code launching the experiment ().

3 - the experimental results that you will obtain when the executable is launched (memory_cache).

### Remarque:

It should be noted that two test procedures are presented: the first one presents the performance levels given for numbers coded on 8 bits while the second one focuses on 32 bits numbers.

4 - Analyze and comment on the results obtained with regard to the CPU architecture you have at your disposal. Are these performance levels consistent?

### Note:

If needed, you can consult the online course available here (XXXX), especially boards XX to YY.

Once done, you can go to the next part.
