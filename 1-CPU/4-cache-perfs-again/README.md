### Stage 4 - 2d array so fun to access and so bad for performances

Caching problems can occur if you don't pay attention to them. This will be illustrated in this example which realizes the accumulation of data in a 2d array. 

In this example, we have voluntarily chosen to freeze the optimization flag at the value "O2" to simplify your analysis of the results. Moreover, in order to give you time to think, you don't have to write anything. Your work is limited to :

1 - open the file (src/reduce_sum.cpp) that describes two functions that sum the data of a 2d array. Observe the slight difference between the two functions.

2 - Compile the program (XXXXX) and run it from the terminal.

3 - Analyze the results obtained and compare them with the results obtained in the previous section.

Once done, you can go to the next part.
