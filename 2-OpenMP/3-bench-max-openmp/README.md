## OpenMP experiments

### Stage 3 - Let's focus on other problematics

To continue your learning, you will now perform the optimization of a function that calculates the maximum value in an array of floating point numbers. The necessary environment for the performance evaluation is provided to you as before.

1 - Open the file which contains the calculation functions (src/vmax/vec_max_x86.cpp) and complete the function vec_max_index_omp.

2 - Compile the program (vec_max_index_omp)

3 - Run the program from the terminal.

4 - Analyze the results obtained.

5 - Whether your solution is wrong or not, have it checked by your teacher.

Once these tasks are done, go to the next part.
