## OpenMP experiments

### Stage 5 - OpenMP is fun but let's make it ourself

You have discovered that OpenMP offers a "painless" way to try to exploit a multi-core architecture to speed up computation. This library is quite magical ;-)

You are now going to try to do the same thing with your little hands... Take the course boards as well as the documentations related to std::threads (cf. www).

1 - Open the file which contains the calculation functions (src/vmax_index/ vec_max_index_threads.cpp) and complete the function vec_max_index_threads.

1 - Compile the program (vec_max_index_threads)

2 - Run the program from the terminal.

3 - Analyze the results obtained and compare them with those obtained via OpenMP.

Once these tasks are done, go to the next part (SIMD).
