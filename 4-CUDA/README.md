## CUDA experiments

This directory contains a set of simple examples that use CUDA programming model to parallelize compuations on NVIDIA GPU targets.

The first directory contains a pedagogical example made for you by your teacher. You should run it and discuss the performance level obtained. The next three directories contain examples that you have to complete yourself !
