# SE301-High-Performance-Computing
 
This deposit is related to the SE301 teaching done at the ENSEIRB-MATMECA school in 3rd year within the computer sciences department. This class is related to parallel programming on advanced CPU and GPU platforms.

The course materials are available here:

The strongly supervised teaching sequence is divided into 4 parts.

- The first one deals with performances and features of current CPU architectures. It is available in the directory ([1-CPU/README.md](1-CPU/README.md)).

- The second part focuses on multi-core programming using the OpenMP library. The associated teaching sequence is described in the ([2-OpenMP/README.md](2-OpenMP/README.md)) directory.

- The third sequence focuses on the use of SIMD features of multi-core architectures allowing processing acceleration. This part is detailed in the directory ([3-SIMD/README.md](3-SIMD/README.md)).

- Finally, the fourth part focuses on parallel programming on GPU targets. According to your wishes and your computers, you will find the pedagogical sequence in the directories ([4-CUDA/README.md](4-CUDA/README.md)), ([5-Metal/README.md](5-Metal/README.md)) or ([6-OpenCL/README.md](6-OpenCL/README.md)).

Finally, once you have experienced all the parallelization approaches at your disposal, you will be able to apply them to accelerate the Galaxy collision simulator in the ([7-nbody/README.md](7-nbody/README.md)) directory.

Going through this whole sequence should take you a long time if you spend enough time to understand what you are doing... that's normal! The important thing is that you enjoy exploring new concepts. If you have any doubts, your teacher is there to answer your questions.

Now that you have read this rant, go to the directory ([1-CPU/README.md](1-CPU/README.md).
